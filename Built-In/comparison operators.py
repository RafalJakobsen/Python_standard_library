# Python Comparison Operators

# TIPS:
## == ==> is equal to
# <= ==> is less than or equal to
# >= ==> is greater than or equal to
# < ==> is less than
# > ==> is greater than

# < ==> is less than
print(10 < 75)
print(75 < 10)

if 10 < 75:
    print("The bigger number is bigger")

# == ==> is equal to
kitten = 10
tiger = 75
if kitten < tiger:
    print("The kitten weighs less than the tiger")

# < ==> is less than
mouse = 1
if mouse < kitten and mouse < tiger:
    print("The mouse weighs the least")

#False ==> 0
#True ==> 1
# > ==> is greater than
print(False > True)

# looking for first mismatched letter
# A - Z ==> 1 - 26
# > ==> is greater than
print("Jennifer" > "Jenny")

# A - Z ==> 1 - 26
# <= ==> is
print("a" <= "b")
